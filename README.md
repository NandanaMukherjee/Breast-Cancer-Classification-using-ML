# Breast Cancer Classification  using Machine learning project 

The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model to classify breast tumors as either malignant or benign based on features extracted from breast cancer datasets. The project will employ various classification algorithms, including Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, and Logistic Regression. The performance of each model will be evaluated using confusion matrices and accuracy scores for comparison.

Dataset Source: The Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset (often used for classification tasks).
Features: The dataset contains various attributes related to the tumor, such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, symmetry, and fractal dimension.
Labels: Tumor classification as either malignant (1) or benign (0)
